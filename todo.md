# To-Do
- Make the field of view visible for the player. In the graphical edition it displays as a different hue, but I had to remove it on for the terminal version and have to figure out how to implement it again. Refer to part-4 for hints.
- Write the logs to a separate box instead of all over the screen
- Make the FoV into a box instead of a weird... I dunno-shape
- Understand the current code and fix the above issues first before continuing the tutorial
- Read the docs
- Make the enemies pathfind the player only if they see the player
- Change the dungeon layout into the rogue box layout
- Sometimes the pathfinding is a bit jank. The enemies walk away kinda randomly from time to time. I wonder if it's intentional. They just copy my movement for some reason.
