# To-Do
- [ ] Write the logs to a separate box instead of all over the screen
- [ ] Make it so that dead bodies stay visible in the fog of war
- [ ] Understand the current code before continuing the tutorial
- [ ] Read the docs
- [ ] Make the enemies pathfind the player only if they see the player. They seem to just beeline towards my as it is.
- [ ] Change the dungeon layout into the rogue box layout
- [ ] Sometimes the pathfinding is a bit jank. The enemies walk away kinda randomly from time to time. I wonder if it's intentional. They just copy my movement for some reason when moving diagonally.
- [X] Make the field of view visible for the player. In the graphical edition it displays as a different hue, but I had to remove it on for the terminal version and have to figure out how to implement it again. Refer to part-4 for hints.
- [X] Make the FoV into a box instead of a weird... I dunno-shape
- [X] Put pretty colors in the terminal
