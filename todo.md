# To-Do
- Make the field of view visible for the player. In the graphical edition it displays as a different hue, but I had to remove it on for the terminal version and have to figure out how to implement it again. Refer to part-4 for hints.
- Write the logs to a separate box instead of all over the screen
- Make the FoV into a box instead of a weird... I dunno-shape
- The enemy pathfinding is made for 4 directional movement. Make it 8 directional>
